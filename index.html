      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Assembler (Python):</b> Developed an assembler in Python to translate assembly code into machine code. Implemented robust parsing, symbol table management, and error handling for reliable code generation.</li>
        <li><b>Virtual Machine (C++):</b> Built a custom virtual machine in C++ to execute binary programs generated by the assembler. Designed and executed comprehensive unit tests using Google Test (gtest) to validate functionality and performance.</li>
        <li><b>Compiler API (Node.js):</b> Developed a RESTful API in Node.js that compiles assembler code into machine code and executes it using a custom virtual machine. Designed secure endpoints for code submission and result retrieval, enabling remote compilation and execution through HTTP requests.</li>
        <li><b>Personal Portfolio Website:</b> Built a responsive website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase academic and personal projects. Integrated GitHub project links and a contact form; deployed using GitHub Pages.</li>
